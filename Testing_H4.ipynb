He was found as an orphaned calf in the Arctic in 2012 within weeks of his birth. SeaWorld was asked to send members of our Rescue Team to assist the Alaska SeaLife Center with Mitik‚Äôs rehabilitation. Deemed non-releasable by wildlife authorities because at his young age he lacked the skills to survive on his own, Mitik spent time at several aquariums throughout his life. During his time at SeaWorld, Mitik actively contributed to hearing and photogrammetry research, which will benefit the wild walrus population.‚Äã\n",

      "Happy black-footed ferret rediscovery day! The black-footed ferret was once thought to be extinct, until this day 42 years ago when a small population of them was rediscovered in Wyoming. Since then, zoos and other conservation organizations have made big strides in helping with black-footed ferret conservation, although black-footed ferrets are still an endangered species today. The Association of Zoos and Aquariums Saving Animals from Extinction (SAFE) program is working hard toward recovery of the black-footed ferret such that it no longer meets the Endangered Species Act‚Äôs definition of endangered and is downlisted to threatened. Happy Hollow helps educate the public about this unique species with resident education ambassadors, Apollo and Hermes, two domestic ferrets.\n",

Threats include poaching for their characteristically colorful feathers or for the pet trade, and habitat loss from unsustainable farming practices. You can help protect parrots by choosing to purchase bird-safe or forest-safe products and products that commit to using sustainable palm oil. If you choose to get a parrot as a pet, make sure you have done your research and are able to provide an appropriate home to these animals with complex needs, and be sure your new pet comes from a responsible breeder rather than from wild sources.

They watched her for several hours before SeaWorld was called to help, and with assistance from the Coast Guard, we transported her back to our rescue center where she was stabilized. It was discovered that she is missing her left front flipper, but no other injuries were found. She responded well to treatment and can now swim and dive normally despite her missing flipper. She will soon be returned to San Diego Bay where there is a resident population of green sea turtles.‚Äã\n",
      "\n",

      "This Endangered Species Day, it‚Äôs important to remember that accredited zoos and aquariums play an important role in rescuing and preserving many threatened or endangered species. Take Tyonek, for example. He is a rescued Cook Inlet beluga whale, which is a population of belugas in Alaska that are considered endangered. Since being deemed non-releasable and joining the pod at SeaWorld San Antonio, Tyonek has been a part of a number of studies that have helped us learn more about the biology of the species so we can better support the conservation of wild populations.\n",

He was transported to our rescue center in Orlando because of our extensive experience caring for young dolphins.

We are happy to report he is swimming on his own and learning to take a bottle, but he is still considered to be in critical condition. This baby (and others like him) would not have a chance if not for the incredible rescue work and partnership of accredited zoological facilities and the Southeast Stranding Network who come together to do what is best for animals every day.

His record stood for 34 years until 2008, when his grandson, Rick Wallenda, completed a 2,000-foot walk at the park. In 2009, Karl's great-grandson, Nik Wallenda, became the third member of the Wallenda family to perform at Kings Island with a skywalk that while not a record-breaker for distance, was performed at an incredible height of 262 feet in the air.

What we know so far about her is that she was an older adult female killer whale almost 22 feet in length and weighing in at 9,000 pounds. It will be several weeks or months before her necropsy report is finalized; however, we can confirm that, contrary to what some of the public has speculated, there are no signs that she was pregnant. There were no signs of human interaction or trauma. There were signs of various illnesses. The whale was extensively sampled during necropsy (animal autopsy) to determine causes of illness and death, and those samples will be sent to labs around the country for analysis in the coming days to weeks.   \n",

    "### Interpretation of Results:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Number of Reactions**:\n",
    "   - Mean for posts with emojis: 533.21\n",
    "   - Mean for posts without emojis: 433.49\n",
    "   - Independent samples t-test p-value: 0.10\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** There is no statistically significant difference in the mean number of reactions between posts with and without emojis. Although there is a numerical difference, it is not statistically significant at the typical significance level of 0.05.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Number of Comments (primary)**:\n",
    "   - Mean for posts with emojis: 33.99\n",
    "   - Mean for posts without emojis: 34.53\n",
    "   - Independent samples t-test p-value: 0.86\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** Similarly, there is no statistically significant difference in the mean number of primary comments between posts with and without emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Number of Shares**:\n",
    "   - Mean for posts with emojis: 63.06\n",
    "   - Mean for posts without emojis: 60.54\n",
    "   - Independent samples t-test p-value: 0.76\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** The mean number of shares does not significantly differ between posts with and without emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Comments per post**:\n",
    "   - Mean for posts with emojis: 52.36\n",
    "   - Mean for posts without emojis: 53.89\n",
    "   - Independent samples t-test p-value: 0.73\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** The average number of comments per post is statistically similar between posts with and without emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Comments on posts by fans**:\n",
    "   - Mean for posts with emojis: 52.36\n",
    "   - Mean for posts without emojis: 53.89\n",
    "   - Independent samples t-test p-value: 0.73\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** The mean number of comments on posts by fans does not significantly differ based on the presence of emojis.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Number of Likes**:\n",
    "   - Mean for posts with emojis: 378.81\n",
    "   - Mean for posts without emojis: 319.76\n",
    "   - Independent samples t-test p-value: 0.15\n",
    "   - **Interpretation:** Although there is a numerical difference in the mean number of likes between posts with and without emojis, the difference is not statistically significant.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overall,** based on the provided p-values, we do not have evidence to reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that there is no significant difference in engagement metrics between posts with and without emojis. However, it's important to consider the context and other factors that might influence engagement on social media platforms."
